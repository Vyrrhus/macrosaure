Fiscal Kombat add-on based on chrome dinosaure game
Trying simple assets for a first snapshot

Reworked everything under 3 class object : frame, "calque" & layer
A layer is made of multiples calque (or none) that is composed of multiple frames (or a single one).
Calques can move within a layer, that is, figuring motion.
Frames are the elements actually drawn on canvas. With multiple frames, a calque will switch from one to another, thats is, figuring animation.
Therefore each layer has both motion & animation abilities.
With multiple layers declared in the right order, one can get a 2D drawn with a sense of depth.
